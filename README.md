# toofake: a bereal viewer

### a client for bereal.com! </br></br> want to stalk your friends, family, or ex without posting your own bereal? </br> toofake gives the ability to view bereals and post custom bereals without ever having to click on that annoying notification

### https://toofake.vercel.app/

## this is a work in progress!
- commenting does not refresh the comments; you have to manually refresh
- posting any image as a beareal has been added but still is buggy! Make sure to upload both images!
 - the location? and public? toggles still don't do anything yet
- there might still be refresh auth token issues
- still need better mobile resize support
- there are still countless bugs (send them over)

## how to run locally

### Using one-click-install-and-run.sh
- Download file  : ```ONE_CLICK_INSTALL_AND_RUN.sh``` 
- Give execute permission for linux : 
   ```
   sudo chmod +x ONE_CLICK_INSTALL_AND_RUN.sh
   ```
- run the file 
   ```
   ./ONE_CLICK_INSTALL_AND_RUN.sh
   ```

### From source
* you need the correct python libraries installed (flask, dotenv, geopy, pendulum, Pillow, humanfriendly, and some others) 
  * in the server directory run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* if you would like better location accuracy, create a .env file in the server directory and add a google maps api key labeled GAPI='your_key'. Otherwise ignore.
* start flask server on api.py
* npm start in client directory

> ### big shoutout to the team at [BeFake](https://github.com/notmarek/BeFake) for exposing many of the api endpoints!
